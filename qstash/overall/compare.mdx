In this section, we will compare QStash with alternative solutions.

### BullMQ

BullMQ is a message queue for NodeJS based on Redis. BullMQ is an open source
project, you can run BullMQ yourself.

- Using BullMQ in serverless environments is problematic due to stateless nature
  of serverless. QStash is designed for serverless environments

- With BullMQ, you need to run a stateful application to consume messages.
  QStash calls the API endpoints, so you do not need your application to consume
  messages continuously.

- You need to run and maintain BullMQ and Redis yourself. QStash is completely
  serverless; you maintain nothing and pay for just what you use.

### Zeplo

Zeplo is a message queue targeting serverless. Just like QStash it allows users
to queue and schedule HTTP requests

While Zeplo targets serverless, it has a fixed monthly price in paid plans which
is \$39/month. In QStash, the price scales to zero; you do not pay if you are not
using it.

With Zeplo, you can send messages to a single endpoint. With QStash, in addition
to an endpoint, you can submit messages to a topic which groups one or more
endpoints into a single namespace. Zeplo does not have topic functionality.

### Quirrel

Quirrel is a job queueing service for serverless. It has similar functionality
with QStash.

Quirrel is acquired by Netlify, some of its functionality is available as
Netlify scheduled functions. QStash is platform independent, you can use it
anywhere.
