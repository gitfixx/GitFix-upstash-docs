A webhook is a custom _HTTP callback_ that can be triggered by some event from
another service, such as:

- pushing code to a git repository (e.g.
  [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks))

- an app is built and deployed to production (e.g.
  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/webhooks/))

- a new user signed up to a website (e.g.
  [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/hooks))

- a payment failed (e.g. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) )

- a new order is submitted on an e-commerce app (e.g.
  [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2022-01/resources/webhook#top) )

- an app fires a failure event on a logging system (e.g.
  [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/webhooks/) )

When one of these events occurs, the source service notifies the webhook API by
making a call using an HTTP request. Because webhook APIs are pure HTTP, they
can be added to the existing flows without using another layer, such as
serverless functions, to call the target API.

Upstash Kafka Webhook API allows publishing these events directly to a user
defined topic without using a third-party infrastructure or service.

Signature of the Webhook API is:

```js
[GET | POST] /webhook?topic=$TOPIC_NAME
```

The `topic` parameter is the target Kafka topic name to store events. The request body
is used as the message value, and request headers (excluding standard HTTP
headers) are converted to message headers.

The Webhook API supports both Basic HTTP Authentication and passing credentials as
query parameters when the source service does not support HTTP Auth. When Basic HTTP
Auth is not available, the `user` and `pass` query parameters should be used to send
Upstash Kafka REST credentials.

- Usage with Basic HTTP Auth:

  ```shell
  curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/webhook?topic=my-app-events -u myuser:mypass \
      -d 'some event data'
  ```

- Usage without HTTP Auth:

  ```shell
  curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/webhook?topic=my-app-events&user=myuser&pass=mypass \
      -d 'some event data'
  ```

- With HTTP Headers:

  ```shell
  curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/webhook?topic=my-app-events -u myuser:mypass \
      -d 'some event data' \
      -H "event-timestamp: 1642628041" \
      -H "event-origin: my-app"
  ```

  Above webhook call is equivalent to:

  ```shell
  curl https://tops-stingray-7863-eu1-rest-kafka.upstash.io/produce -u myuser:mypass \
      -d '{
          "topic": "my-app-events",
          "value": "some event data",
          "headers": [
              {"key": "event-timestamp", "value": "1642628041"},
              {"key": "event-origin", "value": "my-app"},
            ]
          }'
  ```
